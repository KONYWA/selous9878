From the open roof of our state-of-the-art safari jeep, we experience the seasonal swamps, savanna, and life-giving Tarangire River, endeavoring to encounter a multitude of creatures, from zebra to wildebeest, buffalo, elephant, and giraffe, to name a few.

Flooding and drying with the seasons, the soda lake is home to thousands of flamingos as well as over 500 other bird species. On our exploration of the park, we will see monkeys, giraffes, zebras, wildebeest, buffalo, elephants, and, with some luck, lions lounging in the trees. The park is known for its diverse landscapes; not only open grassy plains but also primate-filled woodlands and baobab-dotted cliffs.

            <h3>Payments and Refunds</h3>
            <p>The agreed payment terms apply. Usually, a deposit payment is made when the reservation is done. The amount of the deposit depends on the type of safari and accommodation. In the case of Lodge Safaris, the deposit is 30% of the overall value. Payment of the deposit is due at reservation.</p>
            <p>The remaining balance is to be paid before the tour starts, usually in cash. In case payment with a credit card is preferred, the customer has to add the handling fees that are charged to the Agency, normally 4% to 6% of the remaining balance.</p>
            
            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <ul>

            <li>Temperatures typically range between 22°C and 31°C throughout the year.</li>
            <li>During the night, temperatures can drop to between 10°C and 22°C.</li>
            <li>Zanzibar, located close to the Equator, has a tropical climate with warmer temperatures.</li>
            <li>Tanzania has two main seasons: the wet and the dry season.</li>
            <li>The wet season runs from the end of October to December, and again from March to June. These are the 'short' and 'long rains'.</li>
            <li>The dry season, which runs from June to October, is the best time for safaris, as the weather is dry and sunny.</li>
